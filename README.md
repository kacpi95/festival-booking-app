# New Wave Festival – Fullstack Event Booking App

**React · Redux · Node.js · Express · MongoDB · Socket.io**

A full-stack festival website where users can browse concerts, filter the lineup, and book seats in real time.
The project focuses on clean frontend architecture, global styling consistency, and real-time seat availability.

The application is built with **React + Redux** on the frontend and **Node.js / Express + MongoDB** on the backend.
Real-time updates are handled via **Socket.io.**

- MongoDB models:
  - Concerts
  - Seats
  - Testimonials
- Redux global state
- Socket.io live seat synchronization
- CSS Modules scalable UI system

## Real-Time Seats

- Seats are fetched from the database per selected day
- When a seat is booked, all connected clients receive updates instantly via Socket.io
- Already taken seats are disabled automatically

---

## Styling Approach

- Global design tokens (colors, spacing, radius, typography)
- Shared SCSS mixins for:
  - cards
  - inputs
  - buttons
  - grids
- CSS Modules for local scoping
- No UI frameworks for layout (custom CSS)

---

## Notes

- Development console may show Dart Sass legacy API deprecation warnings coming from CRA tooling
  (does not affect runtime or production builds).
- React Router future warnings are informational only.

## What I Learned

- Building a fullstack app with React, Express, and MongoDB
- Managing global state with Redux
- Handling real-time updates using Socket.io
- Structuring reusable UI components
- Designing and maintaining a scalable SCSS architecture
- Debugging frontend & backend integration issues
- Working with MongoDB Atlas in real projects

---

## Future Improvements

- Authentication (admin / user roles)
- Admin panel for managing concerts
- Pagination for concerts list
- Better form validation and UX feedback
- Automated tests
